# ShinyApp - spotify user panel

- The project presents basic statistics for each listener such as favourite artists, favourite songs, what type of music we mostly listen to
- In addition, based on the PCA, we have created a simple recommendation system that recommends similar songs to the selected music
- In order to create individual stats for the listener, a special spotifyr package was used, which automatically processes the jsons
- Our app connects directly to the Spotify API, so to see your individual statistics you need to know your id and cookie
- In order to obtain the above login data you need to, among other things: have an account on spotify, log in to [Spotify for Developers]( https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and then allow data sharing, where in the next section a special id and cookie will be rendered
- Below are sample screenshots of the application's appearance
